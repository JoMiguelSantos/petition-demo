# Petition Full Stack App Demo

This is a project built with Node on the Backend and Handlebars templating engine on the Frontend, deployed to Heroku, during my Full Stack Bootcamp at Spiced Academy Berlin.

It has been deployed in Heroku at https://tabspetition.herokuapp.com (allow for the app to awake from the Heroku sleep, hence the first slow load).

I developed it along a week's worth of lessons.
